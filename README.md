## 4. **Verification Issues: Identity and Document Verification Delays**

Coinbase requires users to complete identity verification before they can access certain features, such as buying or selling cryptocurrencies. While this process is designed to protect both users and the platform, it can sometimes lead to delays or issues with the verification process.

If you’ve been waiting for your identity to be verified or encountered an error while submitting documents, Coinbase customer support can expedite the process.

Sometimes, users face issues with **currency conversions** on Coinbase, where the conversion from one digital currency to another doesn’t go as expected. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as network congestion or an error in the platform’s pricing algorithm.

### **What Does Coinbase Support Do to Resolve Currency Conversion Issues?**
Coinbase’s **Customer Support USA** team can look into issues related to exchange rates, provide more clarity on how conversions are handled, and assist in identifying any discrepancies or errors in the process.

## 6. **Payment Method Problems: Bank Transfers and Card Issues**

Many users rely on linking their bank account or credit card to their Coinbase account to deposit or withdraw funds. However, issues can arise with payment methods, such as failed bank transfers, declined card payments, or slow processing times.
